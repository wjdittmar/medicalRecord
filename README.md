## Personal objectives for this project:

- Demonstrate basic user management using token-based authentication
- Demonstrate use of the reactQuery library

- Integration with an existing electronic health record system (e.g. Epic on FHIR)
- CI/CD deployment pipeline
- Send registration email on sign-up with confirmation code
- Profile page for users
