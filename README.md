## Personal objectives for this project:

- Demonstrate the ability to take feature requirements and translate them into a minimum viable product
- Showcase understanding of basic HTML / CSS
- Showcase ability to develop full-stack applications using the MERN development stack (MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js)
- Showcase ability to utilize version control (Git)
- Demonstrate basic user management using token-based authentication
- Demonstrate use of the reactQuery library
- Demonstrate ability to develop a Node.js backend to authenticate and interact with the Epic FHIR API, leveraging OAuth 2.0 for secure access token retrieval and patient data querying

## Todo:

- Add testing for the front/back end
- Different access privileges for different user levels (e.g. provider, administrator, patient)

## Possible additional features:

- Convert front/backend to typescript
- CI/CD deployment pipeline
- Send registration email on sign-up with confirmation code
- Profile page for users
- End-to-end testing

See the individual README.md files in the back/ and front/ directories for an overview of each individual component
